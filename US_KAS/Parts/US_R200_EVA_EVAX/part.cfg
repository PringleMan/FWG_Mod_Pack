description = Originally featured at the International Trade Fair as a snack hamper with buckles and a shoulder strap - the EVA-X now finds itself supplying Kerbalnauts with extra resources for longer spacewalks. Although rated for 15 hours of activity, please refrain from running, jumping, yoga, or other fabric-tearing activities with the pack attached. We had to cut costs somewhere.
