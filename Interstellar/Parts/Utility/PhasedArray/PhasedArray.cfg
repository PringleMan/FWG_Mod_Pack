title = Phased Array Microwave Transceiver
manufacturer = Ionic Protonic Electronics
description = Capable of transmitting, receiving or relaying microwave beamed power. The larger area of this array makes it more effective at recieving power. Transmission and relay modes do not depend on transmitter size or orientation. Only one mode can be active at a time per array. To recieve power you must point the reciever towards a tranmitter or relay that is not blocked by a celestial body.
