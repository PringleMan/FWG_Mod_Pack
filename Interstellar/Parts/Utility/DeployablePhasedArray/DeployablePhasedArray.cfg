title = Deployable Phased Array Microwave Transceiver
manufacturer = Ionic Protonic Electronics
description = An extremely large, foldable array, capable of transmitting, receiving or relaying microwave beamed power. Most useful for recieving power at long distance, as transmission and relay modes operate in all directions and do not depend on array size. Only one mode can be active at a time per array. To recieve power you must point the reciever towards a tranmitter or relay that is not blocked by a celestial body.
