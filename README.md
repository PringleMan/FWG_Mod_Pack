FWG_Mod_Pack
============

This pack contains everything needed to connect to the server. Just download the zip, and merge the contained GameData
with the GameData contained in your KSP folder.

The main mod pack requires a clean install, but subsequent mod updates are delivered in a "patch" pack which must be extracted
on top of everything already in the mod pack.

The pack is of course made for the latest version of KSP, .24.2, and will not work on older versions.

The pack is also designed to fit within the constraints of x32 KSP, though it should function fine on x64 as well (stability not 100% for various reasons)

Server address is game.mystacx.net

Ignore all of the "incompatible" mod errors, they lie.

When you first log in there are a few settings that you have to adjust. First, in the very center of the screen there is a box that has the title "TAC Life Support Settings." In this window, un-tick the button that says allow respawns, then close that window. Note: It will probably accidentally send you to the research center, just back out to the space center.

The second thing to do is to go to the upper left of your screen and click dismiss on the message saying KSP interstellar tree has an update. This will pop up every now and then, just dismiss it. I am not sure why it keeps doing that.

That should just about have you set. Have fun! Below are the server rules:

1: Don't be a jerk, respect other people's stuff. Don't mess with it in any way if they are not okay with it.
	A) Because we have an LS mod installed, the exception to this rule is to try and resupply a station. Just be super careful.

2: Don't be a jerk, respect other people's stuff. Don't mess with it in any way if they are not okay with it.
	A) Because we have an LS mod installed, the exception to this rule is to try and resupply a station. Just be super careful.
	
3: We are playing "companies." Players may join an existing company, or be their own. The server should transmit flags without needing shared files, so feel free to do whatever.
	A) Please limit the military aspects. There is only one direction for a military to go, and that involves violating rules 1 and 2.
	B) Two companies may willingly (consensual)(if both parties agree) engage in military actions against each other if they so desire.
	C) Cash compensation will be offered to third party victims in the form of a highly expensive vessel at a launch site to be taken control of and reclaimed.
		
4: All companies must mark their vessel with a unique company identifier. E.g. If Pringleman had Pringle Corp., his tag may be PrC so his Rocket 1 would be (PrC)Rocket 1.
	A) Please try to make your tag sensible
	B) Test vessels do not need a tag
	C) Test vessels may not be left in space. All test vessels must either be set on a re-entry trajectory, or reverted to before launch.
	D) Any vessel missing a tag will be manually removed from the persist. This will not follow a set schedule.
	
5: Companies may not utilize other company's assets.
	A) A company may give permission to another for asset use, such as refueling at X base.
	B) This includes satellite networks.
	C) Stations and bases may be boarded and taken over if 3-B is in effect. The rules for this will be decided at such time that it becomes necessary.
	
6: These rules are subject to change, server MotD will be changed to notify there is an adjustment.

7: If these rules seem excessive, lacking, or needing adjusting, leave your comments below and they will be evaluated. The point of these is to try to ensure that trolling and frustrations do not become an issue, but if they are getting in the way of fun then they must be revised.
