manufacturer = Kerbin Aeronautics Space Agency
description = After realizing that attaching an antimatter core to a rocket and blasting it up into space wasn't complete madness if you left it in the hands of intelligent kerbals, the boffins at KASA decided to actually build one into the structure of a ship! The result was the IXS Antimatter Reactor/Generator Main Hull, a design created to fit a multitude of purposes with its modular truss system. The drawback is that it isn't as efficient as an out and out antimatter core, and it requires an engineer to operate. Nicknaming him and giving him a red shirt is optional.
