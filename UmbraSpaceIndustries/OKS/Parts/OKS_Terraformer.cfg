  description = Take dirt, water and organic matter.  Mix it up, and stuff grows in it.  We're not sure about all of the sciencey stuff, but we do know that if you spread the resulting soil on small terracotta statues, they will soon sprout a leafy green hair.  Can also convert various fuels into water in case you run out.
